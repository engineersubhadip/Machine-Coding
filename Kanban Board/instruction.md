1. We are using Font Awesome. But since, my html page does not know about font awesome. So in our `index.html` we should link the CDN for the `fontawesome`.

2. We have used `overflow-x : hidden` to hide the horizontal scroll bar.

3. We have used `overflow-y : auto` to make the vertical scroll bar to appear when required if not required then it will hide it.

4. We have used `transform: scale(1.05)` on the hover and `transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;` on the element to give animation effect.
